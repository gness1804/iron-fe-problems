//write a function that finds the character(s) in the middle of a string. If the string's length is even, return the middle two chars; if the string's length is odd, return the middle char.

//i.e.: 'duck' should return 'uc'; 'shoot' should return 'o'

//the argument passed in should be a string comprised of a single word, link the two examples above
