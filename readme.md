##Iron FE Problems

This repo contains the problems that I've designed for ironFE, a study group at the Turing School of Software and Design. Each JavaScript file contains problems for a given day that I led or contributed problems to an ironFE session. This repo can be cloned and the problems can be run on a user's machine. Try to figure out what the `console.logs()` will output before actually looking in the console. To run the problems, simply open `index.html` and the outputs of the solutions will be in the console.
