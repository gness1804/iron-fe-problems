##Iron FE Problems

This repo contains the problems that I've designed for ironFE, a study group at the Turing School of Software and Design. Each JavaScript file contains problems for a given day that I led or contributed problems to an ironFE session. This repo can be cloned and the problems can be run on a user's machine. To run the test suite, simply run `npm run test` or `mocha` in the terminal. Try to make every test pass and understand why they pass.
